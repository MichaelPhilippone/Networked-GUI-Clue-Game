Note:
This folder was never actually used to housed the Class Skeletons

It was determined that it would simply be easier to just code the 
skeletons straight into javadoc and do the Pseudo-Code, method signatures and 
Class documentations right in the java files.

see "REPOSITORY://src/*" for the complete source code collection.
