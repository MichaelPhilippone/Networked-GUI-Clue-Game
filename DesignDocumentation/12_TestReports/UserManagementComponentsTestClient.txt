PROGRAM STARTED AT: 12/ 17/2008 12:10:49  (mm/dd/yyy hh:mm:ss)



Testing the User Management Components. ( a threaded testing driver ) 
This is done in several steps:
  1) First, test the connection-handling abilities of the Users class
	  -> spawn threads (specifically, 6) to connect to the listening Users class
  2) Once connected, mimic a Client
	  -> Do so by sending one string (the username) for 
	  		Player object creation upon connection
  3) Next, test the error handling
	  -> Try to connect too many clients to the Users listener
	  -> This should result in those threads labeled with AnnotherPlayer# 
          never hearing back from the server process and hanging.
          (This testing driver will automatically shutdown after 2 minutes.)
