PROGRAM STARTED AT: 12/ 17/2008 13:8:47  (mm/dd/yyy hh:mm:ss)



This test is to show that the required number of clients 
   can connect to a running server instance and properly set themselves 
   for a game to begin.
This includes:
  - Connecting and registering with the Server process
      (Sending username)
      (receiveing information about the player's assigned game piece)
  - Obtaining a current model of the board to display on the GUI.
  - Obtaining and displaying the hand of 3 cards the player has been dealt
  - The first player should have a roll occurr
  - All other player should be alerted to the roll's value
  - The first player's board should light up with the appropriate ending spaces

That is the extent of the preplay.

The console out put from this test run, in conjunciton with the GUI 
  Panel updates will prove that the above conditions occurred 
  (or did not occurr)

Please also refer to the Server process' "Clue_LOG.txt" 
    file for more information on connection and communication conditions

The Rest of this file is the output from the requisite number 
    of Client threads and and their subsequent Game 
    updates and client-server communications

NOTE: this test turns off after 2 minutes. 
      Since no one is playing the game, there will be no progress.
