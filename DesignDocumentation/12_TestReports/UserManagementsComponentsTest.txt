PROGRAM STARTED AT: 12/ 17/2008 12:10:43  (mm/dd/yyy hh:mm:ss)


Testing the User Management Components.
This is done in several steps:
  1) First, test the ability of the system to create a Users object
  2) Once the Users object is created, listen for incoming connection requests 
      -> creating players until there are the required numbers 
         (specifically, 6)
  3) Once the players are all connected, print out their metaData
      -> To show that they are in fact connected and to prove 
          that all of the data was sent on the Socket.
  4) Then test writing a string to all of the players
	  -> To simulate an update in the actual game play
