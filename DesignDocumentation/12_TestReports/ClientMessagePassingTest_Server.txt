  2) send Strings that lead to method calls in Server
  3) receive Strings to confirm methods were called
  4) close the connection

Step 1 is a success

SERVER: from client  Actual output:   -the systemShutdown method was called

Test send() in clientSocket
passed in the update protocol

passed in an error string (no protocol)
Expected output:                    invalid string
