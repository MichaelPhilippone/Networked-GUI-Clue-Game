Move diagram:

Client sends end turn command, not next player()
the server reads the command and calls gameLogic to
update the nextPlayer(), which returns void at this point.  I can make it call move if needed.
Server then calls the move in gameLogic.
move calls the board which calls piece, all accessible by gameLogic.
gameLogic never updates the board, only alters it.
after move finishes, it returns void, the server sends the altered board to the client, not gameLogic.
the new position() method is called relocate, cause that is what we are doing.
change board() is serialize(), which returns a 2D array of color strings.
after the serialize(), the server sends out the update board, not the gameBoard.

guess invalid diagram:

gameLogic calls relocate(), not gameBoard.
relocate returns void.
getOwner() takes a string value of the card name.
invalid owner returns 8, a non-owner, the held cards, returns 7.
getOwner needs called 3 times, once for each card.
gameLogic must call serialize before the updated board can be displayed.

guess valid diagram:
gameLogic calls relocate(), not gameBoard.
relocate returns void.
getOwner() takes a string value of the card name.
invalid owner returns 8, a non-owner, the held cards, returns 7. otherwise, the player number.
getOwner needs called 3 times, once for each card.
CardToShow comes from server, not gameLogic.
show() does not reach gameLogic.  It has no need of that info.  the server displays the card along with the updated board at this point.

accuse diagram:

checkMystery() is accuse(), which takes three string values, one for each card.  returns a boolean value.
the server then does the rest, not gameLogic.
