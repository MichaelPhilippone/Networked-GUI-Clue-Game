\textbf{Note}: server == server machine, not a Server class object. 
~\\~\\
\textbf{\underline{Startup (success)}} \\*
\textbf{Previous Scenario:} None \\
\textbf{Scenario:} \\
The server-side computer is turned on and the server-side software is launched.  On launch, the Server creates the GameLogic and Users objects.  GameLogic creates the Cards object, Dice object, and the GameBoard object, which in turn creates the Pieces and  Rooms.  Users creates null Player objects and the ServerListener object.

Meanwhile, on the client-side computers the client-side software is launched.  On launch the Client creates the GUI, BoardModel and ClientSocket objects.  The client GUI presents a list of fields to be filled in, including player name and player IP address.  Upon hitting a send button on the GUI, a message is sent to the now-waiting ServerListener.  The ServerListener reads the information and creates a connection by calling on the Users to create a Player with a ClientSocket.  The Users logs the order in which the Players connect, assigning pieces and starting-positions based on connection order.  

Once the requisite number of Players has been reached, Game Logic (having randomized the room, player, and weapon cards as well as set one of each type aside for the goal) distributes the cards—via the server-side ClientSocket—to the Clients.  The Server then pushes the GameBoard model to the connected Clients.  The Clients then updates the GUI with the new board, card and player information.  Finally, the Server orders GameLogic to start game play, which allows the first-connected client to begin game play.

The client GUI presents a list of fields to be filled in, including player name and player IP address.  Upon hitting a send button on the GUI, a message is sent to the now-waiting ServerListener.  

As the Server attempts to read the message, it is unable to establish a connection with the client.  The Server ignores the attempt and continues waiting.  The client GUI, upon not receiving a verification or connection, displays a message stating the connection was refused.

\textbf{\underline{Move}} \\*
\textbf{Previous Scenario:} Begin or Move \\
\textbf{Scenario:} \\
The game play has started.  A new move is determined by the GameLogic when it receives a message that the previous turn has ended from the previous player.  Dice generates a random number between 1 and 6.  The GameLogic determines all possible ending points based on the number from the “roll”.  The GameBoard sends—to the player’s BoardModel—a game board to display with all the endpoints (ie: into a room, out of a room, along corridor, or through tunnel) highlighted for the player.  The player then chooses which way and how far to move.  This can be into a room, out of a room, through a corridor, or secret passage, all determined by the GameLogic. The player selects one of the endpoints.  This new position is sent to the server.  The GameLogic verifies the new position and sends it to Pieces via GameBoard and then updates all client boards.

\textbf{\underline{Guess}} \\*
Previous \textbf{Scenario:} Move \\
\textbf{Scenario:} \\
The player has just entered a room and is prompted on his/her GUI to make a guess regarding that room.  The player has the option to make the guess or pass on it.  If they choose to make the guess they are prompted (via GUI) for a character, a weapon and the current room is implied.  Once the player chooses the guess attributes, the guess is sent to the server.  The Server contacts the GameLogic.  The GameLogic finds which player was guessed and has the GameBoard changed so that the guessed player is moved to the corresponding room.  The GameLogic determines that the guessed cards are held by no other player.  All of the players are notified by the server that a guess has been made, what the guess was and that it was not disproved.  All of the boards are updated to reflect the changes made by the guess.

\textbf{Scenario:} \\
The player has just entered a room and is prompted on his/her GUI to make a guess regarding that room.  The player has the option to make the guess or pass on it.  If they choose to make the guess they are prompted (via GUI) for a character, a weapon and the current room is implied.  Once the player chooses the guess attributes, the guess is sent to the server.  The GameLogic finds which player was guessed and changes the GameBoard so that the guessed player is moved to the corresponding room.  The GameLogic takes the guess and matches the cards to players.  The GameLogic has the Server contact the first player holding a card.  The first card holder will be forced to show a card.  If that player only has one, it is sent to the guessing player as proof and the card holder is notified they disproved the guess with their card.  If that player has two or more of the guessed cards, that player will be prompted for which to show the player.  The Server then notifies all players that a guess has been made, what the guess was and that it was disproved.  All of the boards are updated to reflect the changes made by the guess.

\textbf{Previous Scenario:} Any game-play scenario \\
\textbf{Scenario:} \\
The player, at any point in their turn, can elect to make an accusation and is prompted on his/her GUI to specify which character, which weapon, and which room they would like to accuse.  The Server then contacts the GameLogic.  It will attempt to match the accusation against the secret cards.  It finds all three match.  The Server then notifies all players that an accusation has been made, what the cards were and that the player has won.  The Server then destroys the Players, resets itself, and waits for players to connect for another game.  The Client then shows the opening screen on the GUI.

\textbf{Scenario:} \\
The player, at any point in their turn, can elect to make an accusation and is prompted on his/her GUI to specify which character, which weapon, and which room they would like to accuse.  The Server then contacts the GameLogic which attempts to match the accusation against the secret cards.  The cards do not match and the player’s accusation is refuted by showing him/her the appropriate secret cards.  The Server then notifies all players that an accusation has been made, what the cards were and that the player has lost but will continue to play only as far as proving or disproving guesses by other players.  If this player is the last player to make an incorrect accusation, the game ends with no winners and all are notified that the game is over.  The Server then destroys the Players, resets itself, and waits for players to connect for another game.  The Client then shows the opening screen on the GUI.
