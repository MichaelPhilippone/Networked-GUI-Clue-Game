\part{Implementation Plan}


\textbf{Explanation:} \\* For our implementation we have chosen to use 
the Threaded design method, but with a few tweaks.  We have created 
threads based on some obvious divisions in the system, and then within 
them we divided the implementation into a collection bottom-up components.

\textbf{
\textit{
	This Implementation plan was NOT adhered to.  
	Once we began development, roles shifted and the plan morphed based on 
	each group member's ability within the project.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Phase 01 (9 NOV 2008): 		\textbf{(Server-Side Development)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Network Components development	\textcolor{red}{(code:~Mike)}
		\item User management components			\textcolor{red}{(code:~Erich)}
		\item GameLogic Components			
			\begin{itemize}
				\item GameBoard sub-components		\textcolor{red}{(code:~Matt)}
				\item GameBoard										\textcolor{red}{(code:~Matt)}
				\item Dice and Cards							\textcolor{red}{(code:~Matt)}
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item Phase 02 (16 NOV 2008): \textbf{(Server Unit Testing)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Develop suite of drivers to test all functions 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item User creation / management tests		\textcolor{red}{(test:~Mike)}
				\item Network message passing tests				\textcolor{red}{(test:~Erich)}
				\item GameLogic testing										\textcolor{red}{(test:~Todd)}
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Create a board
						\item Simulate moves / guesses / accusations
						\item Test for game rule adherence
						\item Respond to player requests
					\end{itemize}	
				\item Full server testing									\textcolor{red}{(test:~Matt)}
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Listen for incoming connection requests
						\item Create users
						\item Communicate with users
						\item Respond to and update user requests
					\end{itemize}	
		\end{itemize}	
	\end{itemize}	
	
	\item Phase 03  (30 NOV 2008):  \textbf{(Client-Side Development)}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Client class (client-side driver)													\textcolor{red}{(code:~Matt)}
			\item BoardModel components																			\textcolor{red}{(code:~Mike)}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Create cell objects to represent grid squares in BoardModel grid
					\item Create array to represent board
					\item Code the BoardModel update functionality
				\end{itemize}	
			\item Network components 
				\begin{itemize}
					\item from server-side development, use same socket class		\textcolor{red}{(code:~Todd)}
				\end{itemize}	
			\item GUI
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Board representation																	\textcolor{red}{(code:~Mike)}
					\item Users’ Cards																					\textcolor{red}{(code:~Matt)}
					\item Events and their listeners														\textcolor{red}{(code:~Mike \& Todd)}
					\item Menu Bar																							\textcolor{red}{(code:~Todd)}
					\item Server message display																\textcolor{red}{(code:~Erich)}
					\item Game play controls (Move, Guess, Accuse, buttons)			\textcolor{red}{(code:~Erich)}
				\end{itemize}	
		\end{itemize}	
	
	\item Phase 04 (4 DEC 2008):  \textbf{(Client Unit Testing)}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Assuming the Server is already functional:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Test the message passing and receiving						\textcolor{red}{(test:~Erich)}
					\item Test BoardModel Updates														\textcolor{red}{(test:~Matt)}
					\item Test GUI’s ability to display board / game info		\textcolor{red}{(test:~Mike)}
					\item Test GUI’s ability to respond to user input				\textcolor{red}{(test:~Todd)}
				\end{itemize}
			\item Test Exceptional conditional (run-time and compile-time errors)
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item Phase 05 \textbf{(7 DEC 2008)}: \textbf{(Integration Testing)}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Test guesses and accusations		\textcolor{red}{(test:~Mike)}
			\item Test “AI” 											\textcolor{red}{(test:~Todd)}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item When a user quits / their connection is 
						lost / Accuses wrongly, the computer assumes 
						their role in playing ‘silently’
				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
